Once upon a time ShichenQiao is asked to start a story to get some weekly credits for his CS400 class. He added BWurster and Xiaohan-Shen as his repo members and began waiting for then to finish up the middle and ending part of the story. He was so tired during this midterm week, so he really want to hear a joke from one of his teammate.

BWurster was the first to rise to the occasion and attempt to construct an epic tale, condensed into one, short paragraph. BWurster had not yet had any midterms, but he was nonetheless tired because of his intrisic nature as a miserable failure who can't get things done. Try all he could to come up with something funny, he could not try. It was not in his nature. Despite this, BWurster's lack of effort layed the framework for Xiaohan-Shen to deliver big, and deliver big he did.
